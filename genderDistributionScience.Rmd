## Data Exploration and Visualization project: 

### Goal of project: Explore data about people in various stages of education and work in the field of Science and Engineering
I found a data challenge on data.world for [Women's History Month](https://data.world/womens-history-month/womens-history-month-week-2) that asked to analyse the distribution of women in Science and Engineering fields across undergraduate, graduate degrees, post doc positions and employment.
I followed the data to it's source: [NCSES](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/data), which are basically a lot of excel files of the data.
After reading the [technical notes](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/technical-notes) I decided the data seemed reliable enough to check out further as it was an aggregate out of census' and government surveys.

### Import libraries
The libraries tidyverse and dplyr are the basic libraries for most of the functions used in this project. The waffle library  I originally added devtools to get a newer version of the waffle library because it's supposed to have better functionality.

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
library("waffle")
#library(treemapify)
# TODO check out yaml parser
```

After updating to a newer version of R I luckily could skip this step to make the waffle library work. \
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rlang/rlang_0.4.1.tar.gz", repo=NULL, type="source") \
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/waffle") \
packageVersion("waffle") \


I originally checked if the read excel function can save me some preprocesssing work. However, I had to work on the excel sheets to tidy them up a little anyway so I just directly exported them as .csv.
```{r}

#read_delim works better
test_excel <- read_excel("originall_ScienceEngDistr/BachelorAwarded1997_2016.xlsx", sheet = "Table 5-13", range = cell_rows(5:25))
head(test_excel)
```

## Preprocessing of the Excel sheets:
The data collected was pretty messy, for example, using indentation to represent levels of hierarchy across various different variables. It also contains a lot of summarizations of other values in rows and sometimes variables like sex and ethnicity were collected separately and you can't infer how many of an ethnicity are female or male.

The following are the manual preprossessing steps I did on the excel sheets:
1. I removed overarching columns that group underlying columns together and renamed the columns under an overarching column if they are not clear by themselves \
2. I split up columns that contain more than one variable: generally field/occupation, sex and ethnicity (these were generally the ones encoded in indents for the hierarchy so I did it manually and not with separate or spread) \
3. Columns that hold several variables use indentation to show the different levels of a tree structure with some rows like Not-hispanic or Science etc. as summaries of the lower levels.\
4. I removed all summaries of the lower levels of hierarchy and created an extra column to keep track of their parent nodes like overfield/classification for the cases of occupation and field so I would be able to show different levels of granularity. \
5. I renamed most of the columns to start with a small letter, be fairly short and connect several words through an underscore.
6. I added a column that \

Some notes on the data for better understanding:
* ethnicities, race are only recorded for citizens or permanent residents. \
* for easier use in the functions I shortened some of the ethnicities (eg. more_Races actually represents the category more than one race) \
* hispanic or Latino can be any race \
* some of the categories in race were added or removed over the years which for example is why Asian and Pacific Islander become 2 individual groups after 2010 and other examples. \
* I included the original excel files and all their notes in this project so I could always cross reference the excel files I created to the original ones. \

I furthermore preprocessed the data here to create a variable for the ethnicity and a variable for the number of undergraduate enrollments from 2002 to 2016.

Bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering, by sex, race, ethnicity, and citizenship: 1997â€“2016
The values for sex are summaries and aren't related to the race/ethnicity/citizenship. Therefore I have split them up into individual tables.

The numbers in the original dataset don't add up completely, Hispanic, Black and white don't add up to total occupied, which according to the source is because the data was rounded to thousands. 1 in the original data represents 1000 in reality.

## Conclusion
Overall in these graphs I see that more and more young people are getting degrees and that as assumed generally less women are in science and engineering fields. I was surprised by exactly how big the gap is between white students and other students and also female and male students.
It could be very interesting to cross reference this data with the percentage of the ethnicities in the general population to see whether there is less of a difference between the groups in that case.
Overall, these visualisations are a great start to begin seeing some trends in the field of Engineering and Science but it would be great to have data per each subgroup. For example what is the percentage of females and males for different ethnic groups?

Future ideas:
I would like to still try some other visualizations like the treemapify to show the whole and the areas of each subgroup and maybe chose some different color palettes.
